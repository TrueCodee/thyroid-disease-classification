# Thyroid Disease Classification

This repository contains the project for **Statistical Learning** focused on the classification of thyroid conditions using statistical learning methods.


## üìö Project Description

This project aims to classify thyroid conditions (normal, hyperfunction, hypothyroid) using hormone-based features from the [New-Thyroid Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Thyroid+Disease).

The methods applied include:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- K-Means Clustering
- Random Forest (RF) Classification
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification
- Evaluation metrics including confusion matrices, kappa statistic, and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)

## üìà Methods Overview

- **EDA**: Identified feature distribution patterns and class imbalance.
- **PCA**: Reduced dimensionality, preserving separability between classes.
- **Clustering**: K-Means used to explore unsupervised groupings.
- **Classification Models**: Compared Random Forest and SVM performance.
- **Evaluation**: High classification accuracy (SVM ~98.4%), clustering ARI ~0.58.
